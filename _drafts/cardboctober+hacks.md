title: Cardboctober & hacks
---

In October some friends and I started [_Cardboctober_][cardboctober] - our idea was to create a google cardboard project for every day of the month _(I managed to keep up for [2 weeks][repo], though [max][max] & [pete][pete] managed to make the full 31 days)_.

Although we were all building stuff for cardboard, our hacks turned out very differently;  [Max][max] used his to demonstrate some principles and approaches for making VR interactions, [Pete][pete] did some really impressive stuff while putting cats and spiders and space.

I decided to go back to basics and try and build my own 3d renderer using canvas. As I increased the capabilities of my renderer, I was able to create more interesting.

I really enjoyed Cardboctober.  I learned a lot along the way; both from a technical and ux/design viewpoint.  I was pretty sad that I didn’t manage to complete the full month (travelling for work + hacking proved challenging) - my plan was to support webVR with my renderer.

Some things that I guess I learned along the way:

* **I learn by doing** - I think for learning a new technology (or, possibly anything), it’s best to lower the barrier to
* **Completing side projects can be hard** - one of the biggest challenges when creating something is the “just one more tweak”. Because of the time constraint, low expectation, and the fact that you’d probably be doing something similar the next day helped this.
* **getting closure is important** - it can be really hard to get projects to see the light of day, partly because they’re not finished, and partly because there isn’t a _place_ to put them. It’s really useful to have a blog, or be giving a talk as a target for getting your ideas out.
* **Fresh starts are fresh** - I chose to put every hack in an independent folder rather than sharing a common library between hacks. I think this was important - you don’t want to let the stuff that you created before hold you back.
* **100% Vive success rate** - Pete, Max & myself have all bought an HTC Vive after cardboctober was finished


## micro-hacks

This is slightly related to something that I was thinking about at Pusher

## Learning by hacks

I feel like this is a really effective way of learning something new or getting a feel for a new technology or tool, so I think I’m going to try it
