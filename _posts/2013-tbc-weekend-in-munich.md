NOTE - this is a placeholder blog post, as there aren't currently any plans for me to go to Munich.

Things that I might cover if this plan was made and realised:

* Tom took me to the zoo, it was great.
* Tom took me to a beer house place - yeah, cool!
* Tom insisted on buying us Bagels for breakfast, thanks Tom
* Tom wanted to go to the cinema; but actually - Tom - I'm not here for that long, so I'd rather not sit in a dark room all afternoon.
* Tom couldn't find *my* xbox controller, because he can't take care of other peoples things.
* Tom didn't take me to the airport because he had to go to "work".
