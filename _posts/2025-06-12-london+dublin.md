I've not posted here for a while <small style="opacity:0.4; font-size: .6em">5 years ðŸ˜±</small>
{:.lead}

This is some stuff that I've been doing since then:

- **Working at [Oxa](https://oxa.tech)** I had super fun times working on Map Tech and various web things across the company.
- **Moved to Dublin with Sarah** I packed for a couple of weeks, which covid turned into a couple of years.
- **Got a job at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai) and moved to London** started out in Experiment Orchestration ðŸ™…ðŸ«¶ then created the Robot Web team to focus on in-vehicle and remote access tools.
- **Sarah moved to London** after a year of us travelling between the UK & Ireland, Sarah came to join me in London.
- **Sarah and I got married** it was a lovely day with lovely people ðŸ¥°.
- **Left Wayve and moved back to Dublin** earlier this year we left London and returned to Dublin.

I've managed to travel a lot - Namibia, Whistler, France, Chile and a few trips to California for work. I've taken some [motorbiking trips][motoreuro], been snowboarding a bunch of times, and travelled by bicycle on a few trips.

During lockdowns we started [Remote Hack](https://remotehack.space/) which was such a lovely way to connect and explore some fun projects. And in person I loved catching up with folks at places like MKGN, OGN & emfcamp.

Next up, I'm taking some time off to relax, recharge and work on some side projects before I start looking for a new roles later in the summer.

_PS. This is where I'd usually curse myself by saying I'll post more often, but I think I'll just leave it at that for now!_
