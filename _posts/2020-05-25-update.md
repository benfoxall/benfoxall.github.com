I've been up to a load of things over the last couple of years.

A few highlights:

- 🇳🇿 Cycled around New Zealand with Sarah
- 🤖 Started working at [Oxbotica](https://www.oxbotica.com/)
- 🏍 Bought a motorbike

For a more visual guide – I drew some emoji over the top of a calendar ([see twitter for more details](https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben/status/1257382520179605505)).
