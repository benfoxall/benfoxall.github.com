I've been thinking of this idea for a long time and I put up a public version a couple of months ago.  It's brilliant to get feedback from people and I've also got tickets to two events while testing it out for myself ([Keaton Henson](http://www.keatonhenson.com) was great and we're off to see [Daugther](http://4ad.com/artists/daughter) in a couple of weeks).

My motivation for lllocal came from:

* my personalised [last.fm](http://last.fm) '[events near oxford](http://www.last.fm/events/+place/United+Kingdom/6955797+Oxford)' are almost all in London.  Granted, these bands are ones who I'd really like to see and Oxford is pretty close to London - though I wanted to see more live music without spending evenings on a bus.
* [we got tickets](http://www.wegottickets.com/) send out [spotify playists](http://open.spotify.com/user/wegottickets/playlist/4W27ngSpRwYqBPF6OcER0L) to their [mailing lists](http://www.wegottickets.com/#_mailinglist).  I love this style of suggesting people to go and listen to.

The gig listings come from the [last.fm api](http://www.last.fm/api) and the [Spotify web apis](https://developer.spotify.com/) are used to find and play the bands on spotify.  

There is still a huge amount to do - though I'm really happy to have something online.  If you have any feedback or suggestions I'd love if you got in touch or left a message on the [feedback page](https://lllocal.uservoice.com/).
