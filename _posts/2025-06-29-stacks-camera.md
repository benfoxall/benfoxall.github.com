I’ve been working on a side project - [stacks.camera](https://stacks.camera).

[![stacks.camera](/img/stacks-home.png){: .no-border}](https://stacks.camera)

It’s a tool that lets you capture a series of images by overlaying the most recent capture when you’re taking a new photo.

You can see my public stacks at [u/ben](https://stacks.camera/u/ben).

Here's some that I've enjoyed creating:

1. [Window](https://stacks.camera/u/ben/89n1HJNT) - I started taking pictures out of my window as a test, but I’ve found it pretty satisfying to keep adding to.
2. [Circles](https://stacks.camera/u/ben/OW9AyEFg) - stacks can be collaborative, this is one that I created to experiment with that.
3. [Pipes](https://stacks.camera/u/ben/nRezTTQj3lWQ) - it’s been fun to walk around objects and create animations.
4. [Poolbeg Chimneys](https://stacks.camera/u/saz/87XM1YV-VdHX) - Sarah and I captured this on a walk along Dublin Bay, it felt quite fun!

### Why I've been working on this

I’ve been playing around this topic for years ([gif-stack], [video-stills], [scrub], [overlay]), I wanted to make something more than a hack/proof-of-concept, and see if it might resonate with anyone.

It was also a chance to experiment/learn with some new stuff, I’ve been learning a lot about cloudflare workers/images/workflows, Passkeys, image loading/rendering approaches, and also seeing where AI tooling can fit into my development.

It’s rough around the edges, but I’ve enjoyed the decisions that have made it that way! Please do sign up (it’s very minimal), and I’d love to know what you think.
