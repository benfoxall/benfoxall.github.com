title: Find jQuery usage with shaker.io
---

<p class="lead">For a couple of releases now - it's been possible to build a customised version of jQuery that includes only the parts of the library that you need.  I felt that one of the barriers for using your own version was the effort needed to find which modules your code use - so I started building <a href="http://shaker.io">shaker.io</a></p>

[Shaker.io](http://shaker.io) is a tool for finding which parts of jQuery you're using - it does this by providing an instrumented version of the library which tracks which functions you use.

### transport

Once the script has tracked which modules have been used, the data is shared with the main page where the list of your dependencies can be updated.  Eventually we'll add a means of sending events between devices (so you can test on your phone, and the page updates).

		your custom domain is able to share data with shaker.io by embedding a hidden iframe which can share messages with the main window using storage events. See <a href="http://benjaminbenben.com/2013/04/24/cross-window-communication-1/">my blog post</a> for more on those.

### Early days

There's a lot I want to do with this tool.  I started with the goal of reducing the number of jQuery Mobile plugin I was using on a page (jQuery Mobile has a great [download builder](http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/)), though as I've been hacking about with the idea, it feels like it could do a lot more.

### Openness

I've recently been working on [a project](http://certificates.theodi.org) with the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org). One of the (many) things I've enjoyed is embracing open development. At first it felt odd to be putting up your commits for the world to see, but very soon the benefits start coming in.

With that in mind - I'm going to make an effort to make development on shaker.io as transparent and open as possible.  My hope is that people will be able to get involved with discussions on issues & pull requests. My dream is that people can get involved with improving the tool and adding functionality that I didn't think of.

So far I've been trying to make the code as friendly and accessible as possible (no obscure templating languages, no fancy asset processing).

[Nodejitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) have provided the hosting under their ["free for open source"](http://opensource.nodejitsu.com/).

### White October

One of the things I'm most excited about is that [White October](http://whiteoctober.co.uk) (my employer) will be putting some time toward this project as part of an ongoing crucade of being totally awesome.

This week some of us will be looking at the project from a development, ux and design views. We'll be throwing around a lot of ideas and feeding them into the site, so do keep an eye on the project and feel free to jump in on discussions or pull requests.

__You can find the project at [http://shaker.io](http://shaker.io) and on github under [benfoxall/shaker](http://github.com/benfoxall/shaker).__
