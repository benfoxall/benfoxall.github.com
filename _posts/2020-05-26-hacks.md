I built some things a (long) while ago – I found it really satisfying but never bothered to blog about it.

## Cardboctober

Way back in 2016, [Max](https://twitter.com/omgmog), [Pete](https://twitter.com/peterjwest) &amp; I tried to make a [Google Cardboard](https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/) hack for every day of October.

It was an awesome experience. There's something very liberating about having a tight time constraint; you don't bother worrying about making something perfect and it gives you a freedom to put earlier hacks behind you and move on.

I also loved sharing the experience with Pete and Max - we each took totally different directions with our hacks, which meant there was a lot to share.

## Webgl hacks

Into 2017 <small>(don't worry, I'll be blogging about newer stuff soon)</small>, I decided to learn WebGL from the ground up. Before then, I'd used it a bit through libraries or frameworks.

I spend a **whole day** on my first hack, and ended up with this:

[![Small pink square in a web browser](/img/2020-hacks-dot.png){: .no-border}](https://benjaminbenben.com/webgl-hacks/01/)

I'm proud of that square to this day.

Over a few weeks, I explored a few more ideas and learned a **lot**. It's kinda cool to think back to this, as I'm doing quite a lot of WebGL as part of [my job](https://oxbotica.com) these days.

## Simple Things

I gave a one-off talk at a hack day, and I'm sad that I wasn't able to give it again, because I really dig the topic.

It was about applying bounds to the your creative output (much like Cardboctober & WebGL-Hacks).

I described the properties that I'd like from a "Thing":

1. Easily described & understood
2. A self contained object
3. Open to be reused/repurposed

Then I talked about cassette tapes a lot because I think that's a really great example of a self-contained unit of creativity. As well as the technical design choices, the idea of making the a mix-tape for a road trip seems so refreshing sometimes.

## Making a lot of things

Although this sounds like a similar talk - it was entirely different.

I'd followed "what is a unit of creativity" through to JavaScript, and I wrote an [experimental code editor](https://cojs.co/) to play with some of the ideas of constraint and exploration.

Although I'm really proud of the ideas and effort that I put into this talk; I'm really unhappy with how I gave it. I was the closing talk at my favorite conference, and instead of getting confidence from that - I ended up trying to prove that I was worthy of being there by throwing down a bunch of technical bullshit and portfolio crap. I feel sad that I didn't do a better job with that.

Having said that, I just found a [really awesome post about this by Mathieu](http://blog.mathieu-leplatre.info/the-joy-of-microhacks.html). Also, [Joe](https://coverhound.com/blog/post/joe-jv-take-on-full-stack-fest-2017) & [Calum](https://medium.com/@SkyscannerEng/problems-of-today-wonders-from-the-future-d6c9d1eff290) wrote some kind words about the talk.

## Microhacks

I ended that talk with the idea of "Microhacks".

- **Plan the goal, not the approach** – as developers, we can spend a lot of time working out a perfect technical solution and not actually doing anything.
- **Schedule as little time as possible** – it's easier to fit something in, if you're saying you'll "smash something out in 20 minutes".
- **Explore** – if it doesn't look like you thought it would; great! You've got a different thing.
- **Define your done** – make sure you've got an outlet: twitter, a blog, instagram, telling someone.
- **Publish first, tinker second** – we often feel the need for a "clean up" phase. For hacks, you can do this later (or not at all.)
- **Do it again** - Throw away your code, and do it again. The next thing you create is going to be awesome.
