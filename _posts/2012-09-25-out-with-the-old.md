<p class="lead">After more than a year of no posts - I've left my old blog behind.</p>

This new one is built with [Jekyll][jkl] and put it online with [GitHub Pages][gh-pages].  The source is [on github][blog-src].

It seems that a lot of Jekyll sites start with a post about the interesting way that they have been deployed.  So, for the record, I kept it simple and went for the [github jekyll generator][gh-pages-jkl].
