Using QR Codes to send data from offline devices
{:.lead}


## üëâ From a sensor

If a sensor has a display, it can show a qr code with the data encoded in a url.  A use case for this might be [a temperature sensor][sensor] sharing recent values in a [collector page][sensor_values].

![A Pi Pico + e-ink display linking to a web page that shows a graph of values](/img/offline-collector.png){:.no-border}

üõú **Everything works offline**. The microcontroller has no network code and the collector page uses a service worker to load offline.

üîã **Power efficient**. E-ink displays don't require continous power so controller could go into deep sleep between readings.

üî® **Robust**. You could take a polaroid photo of the sensor and mail it to your friend for them to scan it.

üíæ **Collection**. If we want to store readings, we could [sync][background sync] with a server when the collector gets online.

## üëâ From a web page

You don't need a microcontroller to collect data. Browsers are a rich source of content, for example when you draw in the box below it'll get encode your art in a qr code ([source][qdraw]).

<div class="qdraw" data-target="https://benjaminbenben.com/qdraw/">
  <canvas class="qdraw-paint" width="1024" height="1024"></canvas>
  <a href="#" class="qdraw-link" target="_blank">
    <canvas class="qdraw-qr" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
  </a>
  <script src="/js/qdraw.js"></script>
  <script>
    document.querySelector('.qdraw-paint').addEventListener('touchstart', e => e.preventDefault())
  </script>
</div>

You might notice as you add more lines the QR code becomes more dense.  There's some limits to the amount of content you can share, but with path simplification and compression it's not too bad.

The key requirement is that page state should be derived from the url, and once you've got that you can save and share content in any number of ways, not just a qr code.

## üëâ Between web pages

Browser can also **scan** QR Codes using [media streams][media] and [barcode detection][barcode].  This allows us to create a bidirectional socket between two offline devices using their front-facing cameras.

![QR Socket Demo](/img/qr-socket-sim.svg){:.no-border}

I [implemented this][QRSocket] ‚Äì initially as a joke but as I ironed out issues it started feeling pretty cool. 

**Data format**. When transferring data, the QR code is a string "**[RX, TX, ‚Ä¶Data]**"

* RX - is the last message id seen by the device
* TX - is the message id being transmitted
* Data - the payload.


üëã **Bootstrapping**.  Before the socket goes into "data mode", I show the url of the current page.  This turned out pretty neat choice for giving people demos - by scanning the first code they're on the right page to continue the demo.

üì¶ **Chunking**. I chose a pretty arbitraty chunk size. This could be improved to align with a selected qr code size, and it'd be possible to cycle between code sizes to switch to a higher capacity.

_Side note: QR Codes support [structured append] for spreading messages over multiple codes. Pretty cool, but I didn't use it._

üì° **Offline**. The page has a service worker which means that it loads offline.  There's something cool that it works while you're on aeroplane mode.

üíª **Usage**. [Panda] and I hacked together [QRSocket], which feels a bit like a WebSocket.  One issue is that it feels awkward to keep a connection/camera open, maybe something to solve at a UX level by entering a sync mode.

```js
const qs = new QRSocket();

qs.on("message", (message) => console.log(message));
qs.send("Hello World!");
```

üïπÔ∏è **Demos**. There's some stuff to play around with at [remotehack.space/QR-TX][QRSocket]
- [Chat](https://remotehack.space/QR-TX/?demo=chat) - a chat demo which shows pending message state.
- [Signalling](https://remotehack.space/QR-TX/?demo=signal) - negotiates a peer-to-peer webrtc video connection between devices.


ü§î **Other things**. I think this could fit pretty well with a [CRDT] - where you've got a local version of some content and you use qr codes to sync state with other devices.


üéôÔ∏è **Talks**. I demoed this at [Future of Coding][foclondon] last year [[slides][foc slides]]. and also gave a longer talk about QR Codes and other stuff at [MKGN][mkgn50] [[video][mkgn video]].
